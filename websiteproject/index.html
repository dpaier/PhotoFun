  <h1>Some of my Photography</h1>
  <h2>One of my favorite past-times is taking Photographs</h2>
  <p>I always enjoyed heading out ofmy house and exploring the world with my cameras. I find it rewarding to capture images in a manner that is unique to my impressions of the the world.
    My work ranges from still photography to video capture. I feel it important to make statemnets ant to record history as it moves forward.
